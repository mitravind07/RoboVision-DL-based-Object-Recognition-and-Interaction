# RoboVision-DL-based-Object-Recognition-and-Interaction
RoboVision — a deep learning–based system for real-time object recognition and interaction. It uses computer vision to identify objects and controls a servo motor to respond physically based on what it detects. The main script performs the recognition, while a separate file handles hardware control.

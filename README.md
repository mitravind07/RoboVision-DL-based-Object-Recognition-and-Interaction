# RoboVision â€” DL-Based Object Recognition and Interaction

## ðŸ”¹ Project Description

RoboVision is a **Deep Learningâ€“based Object Recognition and Interaction System** designed for autonomous robots.  
Using **computer vision techniques**, it can identify and classify objects in real time from a camera feed and respond to those detections by triggering physical actions â€” in this case, **activating a servo motor**.

This project demonstrates how **artificial intelligence and robotics can be integrated** to perform tasks that require perception, decision making, and physical interaction with the environment.

## ðŸ”¹ Main Features

- **Deep Learning Model:**  
  Utilises a trained object recognition algorithm to identify different objects in its view.

- **Real-Time Interaction:**  
  Processes video feed from a camera in real time and responds immediately upon recognising a specified object.

- **Servo Control:**  
  Activates a servo motor to perform a physical action (like turning or grabbing) in response to detections.

Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed.
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Connect a Camera and Servo:

Attach a camera to your computer or Raspberry Pi.

Wire a servo motor to your GPIO controller if using Raspberry Pi.//

ðŸ”¹ Usage
Launch the Main Script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The script will:

Activate the camera and start object recognition.

Display a live video feed with detections.

Send signals to control the servo motor when a specified object is recognized.
